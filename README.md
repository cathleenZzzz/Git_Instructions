# Instructions for Version Control in GitHub

## What is version control?

When we work on our paintings and drawings we sometimes wish we could go back to a previous stage of our work. While that is nearly impossible for physical works, GitHub can help you do that with your digital work. That is the purpose of version control.

Version control can help you:

- Track every change you make
- Go back to an earlier version if something breaks
- Work with others on the same project without overwriting each other’s work

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform where you can store your work (such as code, documents, images), track changes, collaborate with others, and publish your work for others to see. It works with a tool called Git—a kind of digital time machine for your projects.

Let's begin with installing GitHub.

## How to install GitHub

You need two things:

- Git: the version control tool
- GitHub account: where your work will live online

### First, create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click Sign Up
3. Follow the setup steps

### Second, install Git

**Mac:**
```bash
git --version
```
If Git is not installed, a pop-up will prompt you to install it.

**Windows:**
- Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Run the installer. Use default settings unless you know what you're doing.
- Open Git Bash (installed with Git) to use Git commands

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Now you are ready for the next steps!
